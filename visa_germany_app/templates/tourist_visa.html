          The Old Town Hall in Bamberg, the Schwerin Castle, Nuremberg Christmas Market, Oktoberfest, Cologne Cathedral, and many other places and events in Germany, have resulted to be very alluring for travelers around the world. In addition, the
          variety of beers, delicious bread and sausages, people’s hospitality and much more, have attracted 459.6 million visitors to the Federal Republic of Germany in 2017 alone.

        </p>
        <p class="lead text-left">However, getting into Germany is not an easy piece of cake for everyone, since a visa is required for many. Despite of the fact that Germany has reached visa facilitation agreements with many countries, there are still many
          more around the
          world, the citizens of which need to obtain a visa, even for short-stays and tourism.
        </p>
        <p class="lead text-left">If you are planning to visit Germany, for a period shorter than three months for either visiting family members or friends, or sightseeing, then you may need a Schengen visa.

However, the German embassy in your home country is the one that decides how many days you can spend in Germany, and within which dates. Please understand that there is a slight difference between visa validity and the duration of stay.
</p>
              <p>Visa validity is the first date you can enter the Schengen Area, and the last day you must leave. Whereas, the duration of stay is the number of days you can spend in the Schengen, within the validity of your visa. Therefore, the validity of a visa has been always longer than the duration of stay. Do not violate the validity of your visa nor the duration of stay; otherwise, you may face a ban or deportation.
